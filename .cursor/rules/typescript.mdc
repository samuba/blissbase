- Always use early returns, early continues and early breaks. 
- always use backticks for strings except for: imports, nested strings, console.log, console.error.
- Always use string interpolation when possible instead of concatenating strings. Do this: `${foo} ${bar}` Instead of this: foo + " " + bar
- Always use an object named 'args' instead of individual arguments for functions when the function exceeds 2 arguments
- Always place type definitions at the bottom of the file unless the type is only used inside a function/context then leave it there.  
- Never type a variable if typescript can infer the type correctly on its own.
- Always check if an array is defined and has values like this: `arr?.length` not `arr && arr.length > 0`
- Always create short, descriptive doc comments for function that include at least one example.
