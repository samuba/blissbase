- always assume the scripts are running in bun runtime
- make sure a error when processing or parsing a item can never stop the whole script
- one `scrape-{site_name}.ts` file for each website were scraping
- scrape scripts should have a function for every field in the event object. Like `getName`, `getDescription`, `getTags` etc.
- each scrape script should get the entire html and pass it down to the individual field functions, e.g. `getName(html)`, `getTags(html)`
